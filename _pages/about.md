<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

My research lies at the broad area of artificial intelligence and machine learning. I am interested in multi-modal learning, video understanding, and transfer learning, including video temporal localization, cross-modality generation, zero-shot learning, etc. I am also interested in AI4Science to build computer models for scientific discovery and innovation in fields such as bioinformatics and physics.
